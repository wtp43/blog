## Configuring Single Drive Usage
- delete local-lvm entry in storage
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbOe_-XJQS8

```sh
lvremove /dev/pve/data
lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/pve/root
resize2fs /dev/mapper/pve-root
```
- Then go to storage and allow local to be used as a container

## Configuring a Disk as Storage
- Go to Disks -> Directory -> Create: Directory

## Provisioning CPUs 
- Over-provisioning of CPUs for VMs is allowed to take advantage of idle VMs


## Removing node from Proxmox cluster
```sh
pvecm expected 1

systemctl stop pve-cluster
systemctl stop corosync

# Start the cluster filesystem again in local mode:
pmxcfs -l

# Delete the corosync configuration files:
rm /etc/pve/corosync.conf
rm -r /etc/corosync/*

# Start the filesystem again as normal service:

killall pmxcfs
systemctl start pve-cluster

rm /etc/pve/nodes/<all_other_nodes_in_cluster>
```
